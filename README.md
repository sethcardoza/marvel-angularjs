# Marvel AngularJS Playground

I've set this up using Apache, but it should work with just about anything, as this is a client side application.

ES Lint and Karma/jasmine are only required for development

@TODO

* Some fancy animations, because, why not.
* Travis CI

## Dev Commands

karma start

node_modules/.bin/eslint js/*
